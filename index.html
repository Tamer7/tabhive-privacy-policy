    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tabhive Chrome Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 11/09/2023</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tabhive ("we", "us", or "our") provides the Tabhive Chrome extension ("Extension" or "Service") for efficient tab management in your browser. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the handling of information in relation to the Extension.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <h3>No Personal Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Tabhive does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users. The Extension operates locally on your device, and no data is transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h3>Non-Identifiable Data</h3>
    <p>We do not collect any non-personal data (such as usage statistics) either. All activities of the Extension are confined to your device and are not tracked or monitored by us.</p>

    <h2>User Permissions</h2>
    <p>While Tabhive requires certain browser permissions to function (such as access to browser tabs and web pages), these are solely for the purpose of providing tab management features within the Extension. No information accessed through these permissions is collected, stored, or transmitted outside of the user's device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our Extension does not utilize any third-party services that may collect information from users.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
